Welcome, to the TRILha Mentorship Program! We are thrilled to have you here as part of our community. This repository is where you will find all the resources and submit your homework assignments. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Join the TRILha GitHub Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TRILha-Hub-2024.git
   cd TRILha-Hub-2024
   ```

### Step 2(Optional): Setting Up Your Environment

To make sure your environment is set up correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dummy Folder**: Create a dummy folder in your local machine and push it to YOUR OWN GitHub repository NOT THIS ONE. This will help you get familiar with GitHub.
   ```sh
   mkdir dummy_folder
   cd dummy_folder
   touch dummy_file.txt
   echo "Hello, TRILha!" > dummy_file.txt
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with dummy folder"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Homework Submission

Once you’ve completed any homework assignment, follow these steps to submit your assignment to GitHub:

1. **Navigate to the Homework Folder**: Go to the appropriate subfolder for the assignment. For example, for homework 1, navigate to `homeworks/homework1/`.

2. **Create Your Sub-Folder**: Create a sub-folder named `<first_name>_<last_name>`. For example, "Nicholas_Rodrigues".
   ```sh
   mkdir homeworks/homework1/Nicholas_Rodrigues
   ```

3. **Add Your Files**: For each question, create a new file and name it `<QuestionName>.<filetype>`. Include the question number in the file name.
   ```sh
   touch homeworks/homework1/Nicholas_Rodrigues/question1.py
   ```

4. **Push Your Work**: Push your work to your repository.
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "homework: Nicholas Rodrigues submission for homework 1"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Example Directory Structure

Here is an example structure for submitting homework:

```
homeworks/
└── homework1/
    └── Nicholas_Rodrigues/
        └── question1.py
        └── question2.py
```
